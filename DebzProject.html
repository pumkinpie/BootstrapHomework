    <p class="lead"> Coffee is one of the world's popular beverages. Some claim it is most widely consumed liquid in the 
        world aside from water. Coffee is more a beverage, however, it is a memory, an anticipation, a lifetime of
        consoling moments of the modest pleasure woven into our lives.
        Like any coffee lover, you may have a whole variety of different gadgets and accessories for brewing coffee so you 
        can enjoy a perfect cup of your favorite drink. However, lots of coffee fans absolutely forget about such a thing 
        as a mug. It won’t be an exaggeration even if it says it is one of the main things you should consider in order to 
        enjoy a great cup of coffee.</p>

    <p class="lead">Kapeng barako (Spanish: café varraco or café verraco), also known as Barako coffee or Batangas coffee, 
        is a coffee varietal grown in the Philippines, particularly in the provinces of Batangas and Cavite. It belongs to 
        the species Coffea liberica. The term is also used to refer to all coffee coming from those provinces. Barako in the 
        languages of the Philippines means "stud", and is associated with the image of masculinity. Barako has a strong flavor 
        and fragrance reminiscent of aniseed.Barako trees are some of the largest commercially cultivated coffee trees, which 
        make them more difficult to grow. They are considered endangered due to low production and demand. It is listed in the 
        Ark of Taste international catalogue of endangered heritage foods by the Slow Food movement </p>

    <p class="lead">Barako coffee was introduced to the Philippines in the 1740s by Spanish friars. It was originally planted in 
        the lowlands of Lipa, Batangas. From there it spread to other areas in the province, and Batangas became known for its coffee 
        locally. Barako was also historically exported from the 1860s onwards to San Francisco in the United States and to parts of 
        Europe, commanding prices of five times the prices of other Asian coffee beans. In 1876, barako cultivation spread to the 
        neighboring province of Cavite.[3]

    <p class="lead">The Philippines became one of the top four producers of coffee in the world in the 1880s, after coffee rust devastated plantations 
        worldwide. However, in 1889, the coffee industry in the Philippines also collapsed after coffee rust spread to the islands. 
        This caused most farmers to shift to other crops. Only a few barako seedlings survived, most of which were now in Cavite. 
        In the mid-20th century, coffee demand once again surged, but barako didn't make a comeback because of the difficulty of cultivating
        it in comparison to other coffee varieties. Instead the new surge in coffee production focused on coffee rust-resistant cultivars 
        imported from the United States</p>
